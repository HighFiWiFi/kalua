build()
* bug: minor: same gitrev-tarball must have the same hash
* bug: minor: leave channel in AP-mode, when rewriting profile
* bug: minor: http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/vpn.nat.pptp
* feature+: (testing) no stopping cron.minutely due to SSH-action on all inet-offer-nodes
* feature+: use .txz instead of .tgz for tarball
* feature+: include mysshpubkeys.ipk -> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys | known_hosts
* feature+: include mydesign + mysettings
* feature+: build /tmp/loader + kalua_working_dir on demand directly in the image (safes space)
* feature+: rework zram-stuff, simple append '; echo >$size >$kernel' to /etc/modules.d/00-zram
* feature+: apply_profile: better use dhcp-space on wifi
* feature+: ipsystem() cleanup variables-usage, throw away everything which is not used
* feature+: autoinstall/deinstall_if_needed of: luci-mod-admin-full + luci-theme-bootstrap

vpn()
* feature+: cleanup andi's approach

netfilter()

* feature+: support special dir for vds-data, e.g. softlinked to usbdisk?
* feature+: conntrack_max++ on 32mb+: http://wiki.imagestream.com/wiki/Resolving_%22ip_conntrack:_table_full,_dropping_packet%22_errors
* feature+: check if connection_tracking is really of when '-m state --state' is not used
* feature+: maintenance-mode() on: enforce 5353-dnsmasq + logout all + show special message in weblogin off: back to normal + simulate 8.8.8.8
* feature+: use 'dnsmasq --address=/#/$WIFIADR -p 5353' and redirect splashed dns-queries (test: nslookup gmx.de $SERVER -port=5353)
* feature+: detect 0x1337-port action ("a neighbour reboots")
* feature+: config-option to forbid forwarding for local-net-clients ("no clients"), to have a simple/fast setup on mesh-nodes
* feature+: masquerade "$exception/$cidr"

* feature+: dynamically remove wandev, if not needed
* feature+: switch off lan-dhcp on APs
* feature+: switch off dhcp-script in APs
* feature+: use zram-based ramdisk instead of tmpfs (frontswap/cleancache)
* feature+: measure ssh-port-activity, kill daemon if no action for x minutes
* feature+: build config_profile-specific dhcp-script during startup (lowering condition checks/size)
* idea: instead of crond, use: 'while :; do . /tmp/cron.script; sleep 60; done &' -> problem? does it really safe mem?

misc()
